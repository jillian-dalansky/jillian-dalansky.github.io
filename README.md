# Programming Interests
  My biggest programming interest is building websites for businesses. Specifically looking at online boutiques or other clothing brands. Shopping and fashion is one of my big passions as well in life, so helping create an aesthetic website is something I would enjoy.

# Research Interests
  I think one of my biggest research interests would be learning more about how to create easier websites for people to browse and go through. I always want to make sure the consumer is confident with using the site and so that is always something I am very interested in learning more about.
